    <h1>Hello World! We have a lot to learn!</h1>
        <p>
            Every HTML page starts with a docutype declaration. Docutype's purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML to render the document in. As of 3/18/24 the latest version is HTML5.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we declare the docutype, we need to provide an html element. This is what;s known as the root element of the document, meaning every other element in the doument will be a descendent of it. 'lang' is an HTML attribute associated with the tag html. lang="en" is used to signify english and allows assistive technologies like screen readers to adapt accordingly to language and correct pronunciation.
        </p>
    <h2>Head Element</h2>
            <p>
                <strong><em>'head'</em></strong> Used for important meta-information about the webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly. You SHOULD NOT use any element that displays content on the webpage within the head element.
            </p>
        <h3>Meta Element</h3>
            <p>
                <strong><em>' meta'</em></strong> We should always have the meta tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element. charset="UTF-8" is the default for most languages. This encoding setting is very important because it ensures the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
            </p>
        <h3>Title Element</h3>
            <p>
                <strong><em>'title'</em></strong> Should also be in every head of a HTML document. This element is used to give the webpage a human readable Title to be used in the webpage's browser tab.
            </p>
        <h3>Body Element</h3>
            <p>
                <strong><em>'body'</em></strong> is the final element in the HTML boilerplate. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go: text, images, lists, links, and so on.
            </p>
    <h2>Working with Lists</h2>
        <p>
            If you want a list where the order doesn't matter like a <strong><em>SHOPPING LIST</em></strong> then you can use an unordered list. Begin with the <strong><em>'ul'</em></strong> element followed by the list element <strong><em>"li"</em></strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you want a list where the order does matter then you can use an ordered list. Begin with the <strong><em>'ol'</em></strong> element followed by the list element.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
            </ol>
    <h2>Links and Images</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Anchor Elements:</strong> To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the tesct or another HTML element iwe want to be a link with an "a" tag.
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking on the newly created link does nothing. In order for the link to work we have to tell it a destination to go to by using an HTML attribute</li>
                <li>An HTML attribute gives the additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element's opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of 2 parts</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A name</li>
                        <li>A value</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>In this case we need to add an href(hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. This href attribute is the destination we would like to link to.</li>
                <li>By default any text wrapped with and anchor tag not containing the <em>href</em> attribute will look like plain text. With the href tag present the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.</li>
                <li>You can use anchor tages to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link videos, pdf files, images, and so on.</li>
                <li>By default the link will open in the current open tab. If you want the link to open in a place other than the current tab you must add a target attribute to the <em>href</em> element</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The default to open in the same tab <em>target="_self"</em></li>
                        <li>To open in a new tab or window <em>target="_blank"</em></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>The <em>rel</em> attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>rel="noopener"</em> prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from whish it was opened.</li>
                        <li><em>rel="noreferrer"</em> prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or 'reference') to it. It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>These two <em>rel</em> attributes are in place for additional security. The prevention of access created with the "noopener" prevents phishing attacks wher the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users.  This is refered to as tabnabbing. Adding the "noreferrer" value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.</li>
                <li>More recent versions of browsers have security built in to prevent these types of attacks  if you do not include the <em>rel</em> attributes, but it is always recommended to pair a <em>'target="_blank"'</em> with the two <em>rel</em> attributes.</li>
            </ul>            
        </p>
        <h3>Absolute and Relative Links</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Absolute Links:</strong> Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>protocal://domain/path</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Ex:</strong> <em>https://www.theodinproject.com/about</em></li>
                </ul>
                <Strong>Relative Links:</Strong> These are links to other pages within our own website. These links do not include the domain name as it assumes the domain name will be the same since it is a page on the same site. These links only include the file path to the other page.
            </p>
