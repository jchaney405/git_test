    <h1>Hello World! We have a lot to learn!</h1>
        <p>
            Every HTML page starts with a docutype declaration. Docutype's purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML to render the document in. As of 3/18/24 the latest version is HTML5.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we declare the docutype, we need to provide an html element. This is what;s known as the root element of the document, meaning every other element in the doument will be a descendent of it. 'lang' is an HTML attribute associated with the tag html. lang="en" is used to signify english and allows assistive technologies like screen readers to adapt accordingly to language and correct pronunciation.
        </p>
    <h2>Head Element</h2>
            <p>
                'head' Used for important meta-information about the webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly. You SHOULD NOT use any element that displays content on the webpage within the head element.
            </p>
        <h3>Meta Element</h3>
            <p>
                ' meta' We should always have the meta tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element. charset="UTF-8" is the default for most languages. This encoding setting is very important because it ensures the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
            </p>
        <h3>Title Element</h3>
            <p>
                'title' Should also be in every head of a HTML document. This element is used to give the webpage a human readable Title to be used in the webpage's browser tab.
            </p>
        <h3>Body Element</h3>
            <p>
                This is the final element in the HTML boilerplate. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go: text, images, lists, links, and so on.
